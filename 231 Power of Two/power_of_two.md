# Power of Two
### Difficulty: Easy

Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of two.

**Tagss:** Math, Bit Manipulation

## Explanation

In binary form, power of two contains one and only one `1` in its digits. If we have more than one `1`s, it is not a power of two.

Note that we need to handle one corner case when `n <= 0`. They are not power of two so we just return `false`;
